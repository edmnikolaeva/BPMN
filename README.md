### PROCESS

- **Stakeholder Interviews** – gather requirements and pain points  
- **Current State Analysis (As-Is)** – examine existing workflows to identify inefficiencies  
- **Automation Opportunities** – highlight actions that can be automated  
- **Benefits of Optimization** – patients can book appointments independently, reducing administrative workload and operational costs
