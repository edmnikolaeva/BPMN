### 🧭 Business Context

**Domain:** healthcare / medical clinic network / patient appointment management 
**Scope:** model current (as-is) and optimized (to-be) processes for patient appointments, enabling self-booking via a mobile app
**Goal:** propose automation for patient self-booking to reduce administrative workload and improve efficiency

---

**Key Pain Points**
- Reliance on phone-based bookings leads to manual effort and potential patient loss
- No online self-service option for finding doctors or available times
- Confirmation and cancellation require admin intervention

---

**To-Be Solution**

- Shift to app-based self-booking
- Patient handle registration, doctor selection, and time slots independently 
- Administrator role removed from booking flow

---

**Business Value**

- Reduced admin costs and operational inefficiencies
- Improved patient experience through self-service booking  
- Lower risk of losing patients due to phone-only scheduling

### 👩‍💼 My Role / Workflow

- **Stakeholder Interviews Analyse** – gather requirements and pain points  
- **Modeled current process (As-Is)** – examine existing workflows to identify inefficiencies  
- **Identified automation opportunities** – highlight actions that can be automated  
- **Designed future-state process (To-Be)** - benefits of optimization: reducing administrative workload and operational costs
- **Modeled appointment lifecycle using UML State Machine**
