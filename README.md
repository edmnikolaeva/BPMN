# Business Process Modeling Examples
- This repository demonstrates BPMN modeling of business processes (as-is & to-be) for a network of medical clinics  
- Goal: identify automation opportunities to improve business efficiency

### BPMN Models

- [BPMN As-Is](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/BPMN/blob/main/BPMN_as-is.jpg)  
- [BPMN To-Be](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/BPMN/blob/main/BPMN_to-be.jpg)

### PROCESS

- **Stakeholder Interviews** – gather requirements and pain points  
- **Current State Analysis (As-Is)** – examine existing workflows to identify inefficiencies  
- **Automation Opportunities** – highlight actions that can be automated  
- **Benefits of Optimization** – patients can book appointments independently, reducing administrative workload and operational costs
